# EmailJS Configuration - Contact Form

✅ **CONFIGURED AND READY TO USE**

The contact form is fully configured to send emails to **elexcreatives@gmail.com** using EmailJS with auto-reply functionality.

## Current Configuration:

**Service:** Gmail (elexcreatives@gmail.com)
- Service ID: `service_kme1o1f`
- Status: ✅ Connected and tested

**Email Templates:**
1. **Receiving Template** (`template_hnamvvk`)
   - Sends contact form submissions to elexcreatives@gmail.com
   - Includes: Name, Email, Message from user

2. **Auto-Reply Template** (`template_p9o9po7`)
   - Sends confirmation to user who filled the form
   - Message: "Thank you for contacting Elex Creatives..."

**Public Key:** `J85w1TmWlGhUcK7xU`

## How It Works:

When a user fills out the contact form:
1. ✉️ **You receive** an email at elexcreatives@gmail.com with their message
2. ✉️ **They receive** an auto-reply confirmation email
3. ✅ **They see** a success notification on the website
4. The form resets for new submissions

## Email Quota:
- **Free Plan**: 200 emails/month
- Currently sufficient for contact form traffic
- If needed, upgrade to Personal Plan (1,000 emails/month - $7/month)

## Access:
- EmailJS Dashboard: [https://dashboard.emailjs.com/](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/)
- Login with the account used to set up Gmail connection

## Testing:
The configuration has been tested and is working properly. Test email successfully received.

## Troubleshooting:
If emails stop working:
1. Check EmailJS dashboard for error logs
2. Verify Gmail connection is still active
3. Check if monthly quota (200 emails) is exceeded
4. Browser console will show detailed error messages

## Security Note:
The Public Key is safe to expose in client-side code. It's designed to be public and only allows sending emails through your pre-configured templates.
